          A lack of internet access impacts the ability of smallholder farmers to access global markets and engage with modern agricultural practices and technologies. Younger people are leaving the
          farms because of a lack of quality of life, starting with internet connectivity, jeopardizing the future of smallholder coffee farming. For smallholder farmers to achieve the best prices,
          they need transparent market access.Â
